# Patterns in Game Design for Inquiry-Based Learning

## Abstract

Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) is a social constructivist approach that engages students in constructing knowledge based on evidence and in reproducing, as far as possible, the epistemic practices of the domain through the investigation of realistic problems. Digital games are potentially aligned with IBL, since they enable active, situated, authentic, and collaborative learning in safe environments capable of simulating complex scenarios. However, designing digital educational games (DEGs) compatible with IBL requires aligning ludic and pedagogical goals, ensuring that player actions lead to the construction of conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge. This alignment demands calibrating appropriate challenges, integrating scaffolds into the gameplay, and weaving mechanics, missions, and narrative into a cohesive and intellectually stimulating experience. The resulting technical and pedagogical complexity entails greater planning, time, and effort from educators compared with traditional approaches. Moreover, developing such games typically involves multidisciplinary teams, which can give rise to communication breakdowns. Game design patterns offer a common language and a repository of solutions to help mitigate these obstacles. Accordingly, this study aims to create a catalog of design patterns for DEGs aligned with IBL.
